## **Jetson Modules Brief**
The core modules supported by NG4500-CB01 include Orin Nano/NX, and the corresponding Super version. Jetson Orin series modules have different performance due to different configurations.

The main differences between the modules are as follows:  

- Performance differentiations caused by different numbers of Cores.
- The variation of the CPU/GPU main frequency will has impact on the performance. 
- The capacity of DRAM and it's bandwidth will has impact on the data processing performance.
- DLA/PVA function modules: supports Orin NX 8G/16G, Orin Nano 4/8G(not supported).
- Power supply requirements: for example, Orin Nano only supports 5V power supply, and corresponding differences in power consumption and heat dissipation.
