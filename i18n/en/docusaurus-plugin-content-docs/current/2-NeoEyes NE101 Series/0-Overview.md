# Product Information

## Product Introduction
![NE101](/img/Overview/NE101/NE101.png)

CamThink Event-triggered Camera NeoEyes NE101 is a low-power consumption camera based on event-triggered mechanisms. It adopts a modular design concept and features **ultra-low power consumption**. The camera supports developers to expand multiple photography trigger methods (PIR/radar/sound, etc.), and can be equipped with different sensor modules to achieve **event monitoring image capture**and autonomously wake up and collect images based on trigger conditions, greatly extending the battery life. Its **open-architecture hardware** allows developers to flexibly expand functional modules according to actual needs and quickly complete the implementation from prototype to commercial product.

### Hardware Specifications
>NeoEyes NE101 camera consists of multiple functional units such as front cover, camera module, motherboard, communication module, and battery. Each module is connected through standardized interfaces, which is convenient for disassembly, assembly and maintenance, and supports developers to replace, upgrade or customize specific modules as needed.

### Ultra-low Power Consumption Support
>NeoEyes NE101 adopts an advanced low-power design concept and is suitable for application scenarios with strict battery life requirements such as periodic image collection. The official software supports low-power working mode by default, and developers can also flexibly expand functions based on basic projects.
- **Long Standby Battery Life**: In Wi-Fi communication mode, the default low-power configuration can support 10 shots per day, with a battery life of more than 3 years (theoretical value), which greatly reduces the frequency of maintenance and is suitable for outdoor or non-continuous power supply environments. For more power consumption test performance, please see the table below:
<!-- 
  | Communication Methods | 6V Battery Life | 7.2V Lithium Battery Life | User Suggestions |
  |---------|------------|-----------------|----------|
  | Wi-Fi | 2.39 years | 6.20 years | Performs best under 7.2V high-energy battery conditions, mostly suitable for medium and short range deployment needs. |
  | Halow Wi-Fi | 1.46 years | 4.30 years | Balance both battery life and long-distance communication, it is suitable for remote or obstacle environments. |
  | Cat.1 | 0.83 years | 2.08 years | Supports cellular networks to cover wide-area communication, but it is recommended to use an external power supply to optimize the power consumption. |
  > Note: The test conditions are 10 shots per day with 70% battery usage. We use a 6V battery as a standard AA battery, and use a 4-cell 38.8Wh specification 7.2V lithium battery. Please note that **currently the lithium battery does not come with the standard battery setup. If necessary, please contact us**.-->

- **Low Power Consumption Sensor Expansion Support**: NE101 supports event-triggered image capture mechanisms (such as PIR, radar, temperature, etc.), and it maintains deep sleep mode in non-working status, fully ensuring the controllable system power consumption under different trigger frequencies. For details on the development cases of how to expand the sensor connection for event-triggered image capture, please refer to: [「PIR Example」](./2-NE100-MB01%20Development%20Board/2-Software%20Guide/3-example-pir.md)

- **Open Source Firmware and Commercialization Support**: The firmware source code of NE101 is completely open source, supporting free commercial use and secondary development. The firmware provides ready-to-use functions such as image capture, low-power management, and data communication. On this basis, developers can quickly expand application logic and shorten the development cycle from prototype to implementation. For details on firmware functions and developer guidelines, please refer to:[「Ultra-low power camera example」](./3-Application%20Guide/0-low-power-image-acquisition.md)
