## Product Set Up
### Power On the Camera
Use a screwdriver to remove the back cover of the NE101, install the batteries according to the distribution of the battery compartment, wait until the light on the front of the camera **flashes and lights up**, indicating that the camera has **system booted**, then reinstall the back cover back to the device. At this point you have completed the basic startup of the device. After completion, we can proceed to the next step to configure the device.

### Camera Configuration
For camera configuration, the built-in Wi-Fi AP of NE101 provides a configuration Web for users to modify the parameters and functions of the camera. The SSID naming rule of the Wi-Fi AP is **NE101_ABC123**. Please ensure that you have a mobile phone or computer nearby to connect to the Wi-Fi AP provided by NE101 to access the Web page for configuration modifications. If the connection is successful, the Wi-Fi AP can access the configuration Web page through **192.168.1.1**. The relevant steps will be explained in detail below.
#### 1. Ensure NE101 Remains Powered On
You can press the photo button on the right side of the camera lightly to see if the flash is on. If it is on, it means that the camera is on. If you are debugging the device, press the photo button, and NE101 will capture the image of the current page and upload the image through the MQTT address you configured. If everything is function normally, please see the instructions below for detailed configuration modifications.
<div style={{ display: 'grid', gridTemplateColumns: '1fr', gap: '20px', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
  <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/QuickStart/NE101/ne101_6.png')} alt="bracket" style={{ height: '300px', objectFit: 'contain', margin: '0 auto' }} />
</div>

#### 2. Turn on the NE101 Wi-Fi AP and Connect to It on A Phone or Computer
After the NE101 system starts normally, you can look for the Wi-Fi AP with the corresponding SSID named **NE101_ABC123**, then connect it on your computer or mobile phone without requesting a password. When you connect normally, you can access the NE101 configuration Web page in the browser through the **192.168.1.1** address. If you succeed, you will see the Web page on the browser.
>**In the latest firmware version, the wake-up logic of Wi-Fi AP is to press and hold the camera button for 3 seconds and wait for the light flashes twice in order to lower the power consumption of NE101. You can refer to the screen recording below.**

#### 3. Configure the NE101 Camera
If you enter the device configuration page, let's take a look at how to modify the configuration. We will introduce by configuration category and main functions.

**Image Settings**
>If you are using the OV5640 camera module, you can adjust the image settings of the device according to actual scenario requirements. All content is configurable, **The USB camera module only supports fill light settings**
- Default button: Clicking it then will reset the parameters of the OV5640 camera module to factory settings, please use with caution.
- Fill light mode: Supports 4 modes, for example, automatic mode, customization, always on and always off. Please set this configuration according to your actual usage scenario.
   - Automatic mode
      - Selecting automatic mode requires the additional setting of "Lighting Threshold". The data on the right is the current "Lighting Threshold" value. You can refresh the data through the button to the right of the value. You can set the threshold by adjusting it. The function of the threshold is to automatically turn on the camera's fill light when the light intensity is lower than the set value.
      - The light intensity is the fill light intensity, which can be adjusted from 1 to 100.
   - Customization mode
      - Supports setting the time range, which refers to the time interval to enable the fill light during operation. This mode is usually used to schedule the fill light periodically to ensure image quality.
      - The light intensity is the fill light intensity, which can be adjusted from 1 to 100.
   - Always on mode
      - The fill light is always on. The fill light is on at any time. It does not support setting the light intensity.
   - Always off mode
      - The fill light is always off and is not turned on at any time.
- Image adjustment function
   - Brightness: 0-2 adjustable
   - Contrast: 0-2 adjustable
   - Saturation: 0-2 adjustable
   - Horizontal flip: The picture is flipped horizontally, used when the imaging needs to be flipped horizontally after the device is actually installed.
   - Vertical flip: flip the picture vertically, used when the imaging needs to be flipped vertically after the device is actually installed.

### Equipment Debugging
When it is clear that the **network settings** and **data reporting** configurations of the device are normal, NE101 can capture and transmit images. The way to debug is to press the camera button of NE101 to collect images, and check whether the device data can be collected and transmitted to the MQTT server by checking whether the MQTT service has received the device data.

#### MQTTX Receives MQTT Data
In order to verify whether the data reporting function of the camera is functional, user can use the MQTT client tool（For example, [MQTTX](https://mqttx.app/)）to conduct data transmitting test.

##### Stey by Stey Introduction
> It is necessary to ensure that the MQTT server can be connected by NE101
1. Open MQTTX, and click `New Connection`.
2. Set up the following connection parameters：
   - **Host**：`192.168.44.80`
   - **Port**：`1884`
   - **Client ID**：any figure, for example `mqttx-client-01`
   - **Topic**：`left`
   - **Username / Password**：Leave blank
3. After clicking the link, subscribe to Topic `left`。
4. User can press the camera button on the right side of the device to collect images.
5. After the camera collects the image data, it will publish messages to the Topic through MQTT.

##### Data Format Description
The MQTT message payload content sent by the camera is in JSON format, as shown below:

```json
{
  "ts": 1740640441620,
  "values": {
    "devName": "NE101 Sensing Camera",
    "devMac": "D8:3B:DA:4D:10:2C",
    "battery": 84,
    "snapType": "Button",
    "localtime": "2025-02-27 15:14:01",
    "imageSize": 74371,
    "image": "data:image/jpeg;base64,..."
  }
}
```

#####  Field Description

- `ts`：timestamp (milliseconds)
- `devName`：device name
- `devMac`：device MAC address
- `battery`：battery level (percentage)
- `snapType`：image collection type（such as `Button`, `Scheduled`, `PIR` etc.）
- `localtime`：local time (string format)
- `imageSize`：image size (unit: bytes)
- `image`：Base64 encoded JPEG image data, prefixed with  `data:image/jpeg;base64,`

#####  Visualization Suggestion

Use Base64 image data to quickly preview images on web pages or tools:

```html
<img src="data:image/jpeg;base64,...">
```

you can also copy and paste the Base64 data to [Base64 Image Viewer](https://base64.guru/converter/decode/image) for online preview.

### Camera Reset
The operation of resetting the camera is to press and hold the camera button for 10 seconds and wait for the light to flash rapidly 5 times, which means the device has been successfully reset. After the reset, the device system will restore to factory settings. Please operate with caution. After the reset is successful, the device will wait for the light to indicate that the system is ready. User can refer to[「Device Configuration」](#设备配置)to reconfigure the camera.


## Product Installation
>There are many options to install the NE101 event-triggered camera. User can choose from the various bracket options provided by CamThink for equipment installation. The following will explain how to use and install the main optional brackets simply.
### Desktop Bracket Extensions
Find the screw holes on the side of NE101, align the bracket with the camera, and fix it with screws after alignment. After the fixation is completed, you can rotate the bracket to adjust the angle, and drill holes for screws to fix the bottom of the bracket to the location where it needs to be installed fixedly.
